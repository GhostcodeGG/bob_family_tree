# Bob Family Tree API

Bob Family Tree is a FastAPI backend that tracks people, families, locations, and the relationships that connect them.

## Features

- CRUD endpoints for people, families, locations, and relationship links
- Automatic maintenance of reciprocal relationship records (e.g., parent/child, spouse)
- Optional birthplace, residence, and burial metadata through reusable location entities
- SQLAlchemy models with SQLite-backed migration script
- Pydantic-based DTOs for validated, structured requests and responses
- Comprehensive API and model tests powered by pytest and FastAPI's TestClient

## Getting started

1. **Install dependencies** (preferably in a virtual environment):

   ```bash
   pip install -e .[dev]
   ```

2. **Create the database schema**. For the default SQLite database, run the provided migration:

   ```bash
   sqlite3 family_tree.db < migrations/0001_create_schema.sql
   ```

   You can also rely on SQLAlchemy to create the schema at application startup during local development.

3. **Run the API server**:

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --app-dir src
   ```

   The interactive API docs will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## API overview

Key endpoints include:

- `POST /families`, `GET /families`, `PUT /families/{id}`, `DELETE /families/{id}`
- `POST /people`, `GET /people`, `PUT /people/{id}`, `DELETE /people/{id}`
- `POST /locations`, `GET /locations`, `PUT /locations/{id}`, `DELETE /locations/{id}`
- `POST /relationships`, `GET /relationships`, `PUT /relationships/{id}`, `DELETE /relationships/{id}`

Relationship creation and updates automatically manage reciprocal links (parent/child, child/parent, spouse/spouse). People accept optional location assignments through the `locations` array, which references reusable location records.

## Testing

Run the automated test suite with:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests spin up an in-memory SQLite database, verify model constraints, confirm reciprocal relationship handling, and exercise the CRUD API flows.
